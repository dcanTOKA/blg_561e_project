## Delving into Deep Imbalanced Regression

### Introduction

Data imbalance is very common and ubiquitous in the real world. Certain target values have significantly fewer observations. Such imbalanced data is actually very common and natural in the real world regardless of data sets with different attributes. There are many critical applications that are related to people's safety or health such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis.
