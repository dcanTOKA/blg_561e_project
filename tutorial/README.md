In this notebook, we will provide a hands-on tutorial for DIR on a small-scale dataset, [Boston Housing dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html), as a quick overview on how to perform practical (deep) imbalanced regression on custom datasets.

You can directly open it via Colab: [![](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YyzHarry/imbalanced-regression/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb), or using jupyter notebook with the following instructions.

Required packages:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade jupyter notebook
```

Then, please clone this repository to your computer using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YyzHarry/imbalanced-regression.git
```

After cloning is finished, you may go to the directory of this tutorial and run

```bash
jupyter notebook --port 8888
```

to start a jupyter notebook and access it through the browser. Finally, let's explore the notebook `tutorial.ipynb` prepared by us!
