## Delving into Deep Imbalanced Regression

### Introduction

Data imbalance is very common and ubiquitous in the real world. Certain target values have significantly fewer observations. Such imbalanced data is actually very common and natural in the real world regardless of data sets with different attributes. There are many critical applications that are related to people's safety or health such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis.

For instance , it is shown a clarty dataset for place classification located at the upper left. If we observe the frequency of different categories from high to low we will find that the data distribution has a long tail based on the stored class index. Moreover , the majority class such as living room has more than a thousand samples. On the other side , for rare classes such as museum it is only about 10 samples.
